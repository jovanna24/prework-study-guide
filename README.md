# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was made to provide a succinct resource that would help a new bootcamp student. It helps students who are starting from scratch and might not have a background in software development. I learned the syntax of HTML, how to structure JavaScript functions, and how to style applications using CSS.
